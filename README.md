# TuringTech Frontend Technical Test

This repository contains the solution to the Frontend technical test for the Frontend Engineer position at TuringTech. The test involves building a small part of the main application, which is a business phone system. The application displays a paginated list of calls retrieved from an API, allows users to view call details, archive calls, and handles real-time events.

## Overview

The application is built using React and Bootstrap for the base design library. React is used as the JavaScript framework to handle the UI components and application logic. Bootstrap is used for the styling of different components such as buttons, lists, fields, and overall layout.

React provides a robust and efficient way to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces, while Bootstrap offers a wide range of pre-designed components and responsive grid system for easy and consistent styling. Together, React and Bootstrap provide a powerful combination for building modern and visually appealing web applications.

## Features

- Display a paginated list of calls
- Display call details view when a call is clicked
- Archive one or several calls
- Group calls by date
- Handle real-time events for call updates
- Bonus:
  - Filtering feature to filter calls by type (archived, missed, etc.)
