## Overview

The application is built using React and Bootstrap for the base design library. React is used as the JavaScript framework to handle the UI components and application logic. Bootstrap is used for the styling of different components such as buttons, lists, fields, and overall layout.

React provides a robust and efficient way to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces, while Bootstrap offers a wide range of pre-designed components and responsive grid system for easy and consistent styling. Together, React and Bootstrap provide a powerful combination for building modern and visually appealing web applications.
